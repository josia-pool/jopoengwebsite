shortDescription: Rack designed to eliminate some tedious steps in our analytics department. Before these racks were in use, the tubes needed to be frozen seperately before lyophilization, and then transferred to a container. After lyophilization they were transferred back to another rack. This solution would allow for using one rack for all steps, eliminating having to transfer any tubes.
challenge: Designing a rack that fits 2ml standing tubes, which in turn needed to fit our lyophilization flasks. Preferably fitting as tubes as possible.
solution: After measuring the dimensions of the tubes and flasks, a rack was designed which could hold 55 tubes. The length of the rack was made so 1 rack could fit in a small flask, and two would fit precisely in a large flask.

This was my first design that I sold 40 units (although in white, not yellow color) of to my company, they were very happy with the end results.
